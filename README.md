# jagger
Jagger is a difficult one-button platformer, with inspiration from The Impossible Game and NinJump.
This version has had the third-party menu system taken out, and will eventually be replaced with my own implementation. For now, the player starts in level 1 and proceeds automatically.

Play online at: http://samasmith.co.uk/jagger.html

Control:
Space/Click to jump. The character will run forward and climb walls by itself, simply let it survive until the end of each level.

Edited to only include my own programming.
